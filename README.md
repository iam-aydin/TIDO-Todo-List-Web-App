Understood. Here's the revised documentation with Markdown formatting for GitHub's README.md file:

# Todo List Web App Documentation

## Overview
This is a simple todo list web application built using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework. The application allows users to add tasks to a list and delete them.

## Dependencies
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **Body-parser**: Middleware used to extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on `req.body`.

## Application Setup
The application is set up using Express.js and listens on port 3000. It uses static files from the "public" directory and EJS as the view engine.

## Routes
There are three routes in the application:

1. **GET /**: This route renders the index page with the current list of tasks.

2. **POST /Tasks**: This route adds a new task to the list. The task is taken from the request body.

3. **POST /delete**: This route deletes a task from the list. The index of the task to be deleted is taken from the request body.

## Server Startup
Finally, the application starts listening on the specified port.

Please note that this is a basic documentation. Depending on the complexity of your application, you might want to include more details such as error handling, database integration, etc.
